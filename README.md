# Remote Sensing Image Super-Resolution via Mixed High-Order Attention Network (MHAN)
The pytorch code for paper Remote Sensing Image Super-Resolution via Mixed High-Order Attention Network
The Test30 dataset used in the paper can be found in this repositoryï¼Œ referring to the folder './Test30'
Some other general image and remote sensing SR based models also provided in folder './models'

# Requirements

- Python 3.6.4
- Pytorch 1.3.1(GPU)
- OpenCV
- NVIDIA-SMI 430.64       
- Driver Version: 430.64       
- CUDA Version: 10.1  

# Usage
Use the following command to train the model. 
```
$ python main_x4.py
```
Use the following commandss to generate the SR images with respect to RSSCN7 and WHURS19 datasets. 
```
$ python eval_RSSCN7.py
$ python eval_WHURS19.py
```
When the SR images are generated in the folder, use Evaluate_PSNR_SSIM.m file to comptute the PSNR and SSIM.
